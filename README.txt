To do list app created using Python only. The front end was created using the Tkinter Library, while the backend is created with sqlite3 Library

All core features are working. Remaining fixes include:
- 'Enter' on keyboard must invoke Submit button.
- Add new todo input field must be cleared after Adding a previous item.
- When removing an item, the UI must refresh correctly.
